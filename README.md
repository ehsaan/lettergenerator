Communicating with representatives is one of the many ways constituents can get their voices heard. 
As it turns out, the simple steps to contact a Senator or Congressperson are perceived as a deterrent to some, if not many. 

Using Google's fantastic APIs (Forms, Docs, Scripts, Apps) in a matter of hours I could create a platform that would ask simple questions from users and adapt a preset template based on their information. It would use user's address and Google Civic API to get name and addresses of representatives.

The updated template is emailed to users as a PDF. I did not intend to email the representatives to avoid abuse. Regardless, normal users are limited to 100 emails per day, so there would be a hard limit.

I *may* add variations that can do more than just using a templated, and adaptively create letters based on user input (through Google Forms).
